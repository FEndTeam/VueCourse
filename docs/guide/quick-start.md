# Quick Start

Depending on your use case and preference, you can use Vue with or without a build step.

## With Build Tools

A build setup allows us to use Vue [Single-File Components]. The official Vue build setup is based on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), a frontend build tool that is modern, lightweight and extremely fast.

### Online

You can try Vue with SFCs online on [StackBlitz](https://vite.new/vue). StackBlitz runs the Vite-based build setup directly in the browser, so it is almost identical to the local setup but doesn't require installing anything on your machine.

### Local
